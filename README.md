📊 Absence of Insights for the Relationship Between Student's Economic Background, Academic Performance, Competence & Expected Salary
🏫 Industry Academia Community – Data Analytics Live Project

Domain: Data Analytics
Intern Name: Madhura Tembe
Project Type: Individual Internship Project

📌 Project Overview

This project aims to analyze and identify the relationship between a student’s economic background, academic performance, competence level, and expected salary.
Many institutions collect student data but fail to extract meaningful insights that can help in career guidance and policy making.
This project uses data analytics techniques to uncover hidden patterns and correlations in student data.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze how family income/economic background affects academic performance (CGPA).

Study the impact of skills and competence on expected salary.

Identify top-performing colleges based on student CGPA.

Understand city-wise participation and graduation trends.

Provide actionable insights using visual analytics.

🧩 Dataset Description

Final Submission

📈 Key Insights

Students with higher competence levels tend to expect higher salaries.

Economic background shows moderate correlation with academic performance.

Certain colleges consistently perform better in terms of CGPA.

Skills play a stronger role in salary expectation than income background alone.

(Exact results may vary based on dataset sample.)

📚 Lessons Learned

Data cleaning consumes the most time but is critical for accurate analysis.

Visualization makes complex relationships easier to understand.

Correlation does not always mean causation; interpretation is important.

Structuring work using WBS improves project tracking.

🚀 Future Scope

Apply Machine Learning models for salary prediction.

Include real-time data collection from students.

Add dashboard using Power BI or Tableau.

Perform clustering of student profiles.
